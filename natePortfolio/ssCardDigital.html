        <h1>Update Record and Get a Social Security Card</h1>
        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>
          Nearly everyone in America at some point in their life needs a Social
          Security card. Hundreds of thousands of people each month request
          Social Security card services. Their reasons may be for proof to work,
          their child's first card, or a new card with an updated name. The
          latter often occurs after marriage and was the use case we evaluated
          for this project. Our capacity to serve these customers in person is
          no longer viable based on demand and capacity.
        </p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
          Increase in online usage by over 10%. Statistically significant
          increase in customer satisfaction by 2-3% annually. for

          <li>
            Talk to staff in the offices to understand how they perceive and
            address the problem.

        <h2>Problem Space</h2>
        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>
          The agency responded to an increasingly high demand for Social
          Security card services by requiring every customer to schedule an
          appointment before visiting an office. While this helped staff and
          offices better manage their time, it often worsened the conditions for
          customers as they were not well informed and may have already traveled
          to an office where they were informed they need an appointment.
        </p>
        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>
          This approach did not address the root cause of the problem and the
          demand for these services was still too high for our staff to process
          requests timely. The federal government was under a hiring freeze for
          the foreseeable future.
        </p>
        <h3>Goals and Objectives</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Design a process that incorporated changes to the digital products
            and services so more customers would go online and find success.
          </li>
          <li>
            Start collecting feedback from members of the public to inform
            agency decision-making.
          </li>
          <li>
            Close the loop with customers experiencing issues online or with
            their attempts to obtain service.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ongoing communication with customers and employees about their
            experience throughout their journey life-cycle.
          </li>
        </ul>

        pages.

        <p>
          Detail the user flow steps from the perspective of subject matter
          experts. We diagrammed the flow to understand how the process aligns
          to the actual experience we would observe in later research.

        <h2>Journey Map</h2>

        <p>
          Our customer journey map focused on telling an emotional story from
          Willow’s point of view. We wanted to show how her emotions moved from
          anger to joy throughout and highlight opportunity areas to improve. We
          conducted interviews and synthesized open-ended feedback from our
          Voice of Customer platform – Medallia.

        <h2>Service Blueprint</h2>

        <p>
          In this case, we had to consider multiple touch points and
          interactions including web, phone, and in-person visits. This
          blueprint demonstrates the complexities of human interactions within
          complex systems. We conducted ethnographic studies to understand the
          behaviors of our customers, employees, and the props they interacted
          with.

        <h2>Design Prototype</h2>
        <p>
          From our research and analysis we learned the path through the digital
          card product wasn't as straightforward in real life. There were 5
          different product teams working in silos and building disjointed
          systems. This meant the customer was often left to find their way
          through a maze of information and poor handoffs between product
          boundaries.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Understanding the customer’s satisfaction across different journeys
          and service areas allowed us to map experiences, blueprint
          interactions, and scope problems to find meaningful solutions. We
          hosted bi-weekly open office hours to allow product team members,
          executives, and regional staff to come and ask questions or learn from
          others' questions.
