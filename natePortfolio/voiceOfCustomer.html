        <h1>Voice of Customer</h1>
        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>
          The agency did not have an ongoing communication strategy with our
          customers or employees. Feedback collected from customers was not
          scaled to support enterprise wide actions or strategic decision
          making.
        </p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
          We were able to deploy over 20 surveys that collected feedback for
          general web users, specific digital product touchpoints, in-person
          visits, and phone interactions. During the first year, we onboarded
          over 300 employees in various roles including executives, regional
          office staff, office managers, and product team members.
        </p>
        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>
          <li>Build standard templates for surveys and dashboard reports.</li>
          <li>
            Create service desk for internal staff to submit JIRA tickets.
          </li>
          <li>
            Schedule a meeting to discuss needs and goals for capturing customer
            feedback.
          </li>
          <li>Customize templates based on specific team goals.</li>
          <li>Deploy survey and report dashboard.</li>
          <li>Support their learning and help discover insights.</li>
        </p>

        <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
        <p>
          Staff members often were unsure of what their over-arching goals were
          once they collected feedback from customers. It was our purpose to
          understand their needs, help them determine the best way to capture
          customer feedback, and identify metrics to define success.

        <h2>Problem Space</h2>
        <h3>Challenge</h3>
        <p>
          Create a Voice of Customer program that provides a way for product
          teams to collect and review customer feedback. Ensure it can scale to
          an enterprise solution.
        </p>
        <h3>Goals and Objectives</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Deploy a Voice of Customer program for enterprise usage across the
            agency.
          </li>
          <li>
            Start collecting feedback from members of the public to inform
            agency decision-making.
          </li>
          <li>
            Close the loop with customers experiencing issues online or with
            their attempts to obtain service.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ongoing communication with customers and employees about their
            experience throughout their journey life-cycle.
          </li>
        </ul>
        Below is an example of scaling embedded surveys across particular web
        pages.

      <section id="problem-space">
        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>
          We collected feedback from customers in various ways including:
          <li>Targeted surveys (recent interactions)</li>
          <li>Always-on surveys (passive, customer initiated)</li>
          <li>Intercept surveys (recent interactions)</li>
          We also gathered feedback by placing cards with QR code at each
          employees desk. And, we provided links on mailed notices and
          interaction receipts.

        <h2>Monitoring Feedback</h2>
        <h3>CX Perception Metrics</h3>
        <p>
          We monitored primary CX metrics as customer satisfaction (CSAT) and
          trust. We built reports that allowed us to understand normal service
          trends over time. Then we could highlight changes after key events
          like product enhancements, policy changes, or unexpected closures.

        />
        <h3>CX Perception Drivers</h3>
        <p>
          We used CX drivers to understand the factors affecting CSAT and trust.
          Ease of doing business made the highest impact to customers describing
          a satisfactory interaction. Customers that left more neutral responses
          often were happy with the service representative but unhappy with the
          difficulty and complexity of completing their business.

        />
        <h3>Perception and Interaction Data</h3>
        <p>
          We paired this customer perception data with business interaction data
          to understand the full scope and severity of opportunity areas.

      <section id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Understanding the customerâ€™s satisfaction across different journeys
          and service areas allowed us to map experiences, blueprint
          interactions, and scope problems to find meaningful solutions. We
          hosted bi-weekly open office hours to allow product team members,
          executives, and regional staff to come and ask questions or learn from
          others' questions.
