        <h1>Digital Identity Enhancements</h1>
        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>
          Our account creation problem was too difficult for people to complete.
          Our most complicated and time-consuming services require people to
          create an account. When they are unsuccessful, they call or walk into
          an office. This cost taxpayers money.
        </p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
          We were eventually able to increase the success rate from around 40%
          to over 80%. This took many iterations and using Lean UX practices.
        </p>
        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>
          For this project, we began by testing the product end-to-end. Once we
          identified key problem areas, we redesigned and tested again but this
          time focused primarily on the problem space and surrounding
          boundaries. We repeated this process many time which enabled us to
          iterate fast and deliver prototypes to our engineers on a regular
          cadence. Our goal for each two week sprint was design, test, iterate,
          share, and repeat.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
        <p>
          Users struggled at very distinct points within the process which led
          to frustration and often times, failed interactions. The existing
          process was outdated and relied on user's memory - knowledge-based
          questions to verify an individual's identity. Reliance on memory often
          leads to errors and failures. Many of our customers are elderly and
          sometimes were asked to remember questions about their past credit
          more than 10-20 years. For example, "What bank financed your first
          car?"

        <h2>Understanding the Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Our account creation process was over burdensome and outdated. We
          needed to increase the success rate as nearly all of our online
          services required a user to verify their identity. We began by
          establishing a baseline to understand our overall success rate and
          where users often bounce or abandon the online experience. We
          discovered that the two main steps where we lost users was answering
          questions about their credit history and using their credit cards to
          verify financial history.

        <h2>Problem Space</h2>
        <p>
          Our goal for this activtity was to write a clear and concise problem
          statement. Scope the problem to the point without being overly
          specific. Agree on the problem statement.

        <h3>5 Whys Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          We wanted to ensure we focused on solving the root cause of the
          problem and not get hung up on symptomatic details.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          We were able to provide users with different options to verify their
          identity. These methods included using photos of an ID (upload or snap
          a photo) or typing the information. If they used the photo ID, they
          would also take a selfie for liveness recognition. If they chose to
          type the information, they would have to verify another certified
          document such as a credit card or mortgage statement.
