        <h1>Update Record and Get a Social Security Card</h1>
        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>
          Nearly everyone in America at some point in their life needs a Social
          Security card. Hundreds of thousands of people each month request
          Social Security card services. Their reasons may be for proof to work,
          their child's first card, or a new card with an updated name. The
          latter often occurs after marriage and was the use case we evaluated
          for this project. Our capacity to serve these customers in person is
          no longer viable based on demand.
        </p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
          Increase in online usage by over 15-20%. <br />Statistically
          significant increase in customer satisfaction by 2-3%.
        </p>
        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>
          <li>
            Scrutinize the problem space and identify the boundaries of the
            problem.
          </li>
          <li>Understand who our users are and what are there needs.</li>
          <li>
            Talk to staff in the offices to understand how they perceive and
            address the problem.
          </li>

          <li>Ideate through creative design sessions with stakeholders.</li>
          <li>
            Build personas, user flows, journey maps, and service blueprints to
            understand the experience of both customers and staff.
          </li>
          <li>
            Translate wireframes into high fidelity prototypes for user testing.
          </li>
        </p>

        <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
        <p>
          Customers were not well informed of this new business model and showed
          up expecting in-person service. They also had many issues trying to
          navigate the online application to request a card and could not easily
          find the existing scheduling system.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="analysis">
        <h2>Problem Space</h2>
        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>
          The agency responded to an increasingly high demand for Social
          Security card services by requiring every customer to schedule an
          appointment before visiting an office. While this helped staff and
          offices better manage their time, it often worsened the conditions for
          customers. They were not well informed and traveled to an office to be
          denied service. They were further frustrated after waiting weeks or
          months for an appointment that only took about 10 minutes.
        </p>
        <h3>Challenge</h3>
        <p>
          This approach did not address the root cause of the problem and the
          demand for these services was still too high for our staff to process
          requests timely. The appointment backlog grew. Early on the problem
          was misinterpreted and likely the result of poor measurement
          practices. The federal government was under a hiring freeze for the
          foreseeable future.
        </p>
        <h3>Goals and Objectives</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Analyze the process end-to-end -from initial contact till they
            received their card and left feedback.
          </li>

          <li>
            Find the touchpoints that posed the greatest challenges for
            customers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Design a process that incorporated changes to the digital products
            and services so more customers would go online and find success.
          </li>
          <li>
            Close online service gaps so customer's path led to either
            successful requests or a scheduled appointment. Eliminate fall-outs
            paths.
          </li>
          <li>Allow people to walk in without an appointment again.</li>

            Their preferred channel is the web and due due to a busy life style.

        <h3>Our Approach</h3>
        <p>
          Detail the user flow steps from the perspective of subject matter
          experts. We diagrammed the flow to understand how the process aligns
          to the actual experience we would observe in later research.

        <h2>Journey Map</h2>

        <p>
          Our customer journey map focused on telling an emotional story from
          Willow’s point of view. We wanted to show how her emotions moved from
          anger to joy throughout and highlight opportunity areas to improve. We
          conducted interviews and synthesized open-ended feedback from our
          Voice of Customer platform – Medallia.

        <h2>Service Blueprint</h2>

        <p>
          In this case, we had to consider multiple touch points and
          interactions including web, phone, and in-person visits. This
          blueprint demonstrates the complexities of human interactions within
          complex systems. We conducted ethnographic studies to understand the
          behaviors of our customers, employees, and the props they interacted
          with.

        <h2>Design Prototype</h2>
        <p>
          From our research and analysis we learned the path through the digital
          card product wasn't as straightforward in real life. There were 5
          different product teams working in silos and building disjointed
          systems. This meant the customer was often left to find their way
          through a maze of information and poor handoffs between product
          boundaries.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          The new process created a more equitable and improved customer
          experience. To find success in solving this type of problem, it is
          paramount that you step in the customer’s shoes. You need to
          experience how they interact with the people, process, and technology
          that enables service. The best journey incorporates all available
          props and technology (i.e. web, phone, SMS, mail, etc.) to create a
          seamless, omnichannel experience.
